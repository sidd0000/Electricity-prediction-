AI-Based Electricity Demand Forecasting for Indian Power Systems
This project develops an AI-based model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast electricity demand, production, and peak demand for Indian states. The model predicts electricity production from various sources (coal, solar, etc.) for a 5-month horizon, helping grid operators and policymakers make informed decisions.

Overview
The AI model utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict:

Total electricity production
Peak electricity demand
Coal and solar production for a 5-month period
The goal is to optimize grid management and resource allocation for better energy sustainability, particularly focusing on power systems in Indian states.

Technologies Used
Python for coding
TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM model development
NumPy for data manipulation
Pandas for data preprocessing
Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, etc.)
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical electricity demand and production data, with separate columns for total production, peak demand, coal pr
